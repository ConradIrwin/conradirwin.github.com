Hi, I'm Conrad, one of the maintainers of Pry.

Before we get started, how many of you already know what Pry is?

And how many of you use it regularly?

Cool, lots of you!

Pry. For those of you who don't know, it's a ruby shell. If you've used IRB, you'll get the idea pretty quickly. You type in ruby, it gives you the answer. Luckily, pry has a few more tricks up its sleeve, and today I'll explain how it can make you better at debugging.

If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.

All code has bugs, this is something that even after half a century we don't seem any closer to solving.
